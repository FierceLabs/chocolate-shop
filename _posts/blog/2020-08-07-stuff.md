#### Imagine finding a letter from your past self. What would it say? What would have changed since then?

> I don't know when I wrote this.
> I found a letter about who I would become.
> It was folded into a paper plane.
> I don't know why I wrote this.
> But I know it's what I need to hear.
> When did I start living life in fear?
>
> Camp fires, rusted cars.
> Conversations, my guitar.
> It's been so long since we've seen the coast.
> Writing stupid songs.
> Homemade boats that always sunk.
> Time spent with the ones you love the most.
>
> We were singin'
> Ooooooo
> Late at night.
> All these dreams.
> They won't let me sleep.
>
> Oooooooo
> Turns out memories
> are the only things we keep.
>
> I want to grow up, but not grow old.
> These hurricanes won't drown our hope.
>
> Oooooooo
> Late night, all these dreams.
> They won't let me sleep.
>
> I just saw you smile.
> Remember that day, you were dressed in white?
> Since then I've picked up a thousand cares.
> So I'll write you a letter,
> telling you about who we could become.
> We'll have to work together to get there.
> Phone calls with my dad.
> Innocent pranks gone bad.
> It's been so long since we've seen the road.
> Bare feet on cold grass.
> The friendships that didn't last.
> We're learning not to talk in code.
>
> We were singin'
> Ooooooo
> Late at night.
> All these dreams.
> They won't let me sleep.
>
> Oooooooo
> Turns out memories
> are the only things we keep.
>
> I want to grow up, but not grow old.
> These hurricanes won't drown our hope.
>
> Oooooooo
> Late night, all these dreams.
> They won't let me sleep.
>
> Don't give up, don't don't give up now!
> Don't give up, don't don't give up.

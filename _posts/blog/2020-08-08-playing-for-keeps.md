#### When you find a once-in-a-lifetime kind of girl, you hold on to her and you don't let go.

> We were running downtown.
> That November was so cold.
> Every bit of me was screaming 'DON'T GO'.
> You were showing me postcards.
> You asked why I was sad.
> Babe, I had never wanted something so bad.
>
> Cupid don't miss.
> My heart is a fist.
> 5 years have passed since I felt like this.
> I need a way to let you know,
> I'm holding on with both of my hands.
>
> I won't let you GO!
> NO!
> A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds.
> Baby, I'm playing for keeps.
>
> I remember walking away from that green apartment door.
> Babe, I had though I wouldn't see you anymore.
> Every step I took, it cut me like a knife.
> My fists were clenched and my knuckles were white.
>
> Cupid don't miss.
> My heart is a fist.
> 5 years have passed since I felt like this.
> I need a way to let you know,
> I'm holding on with both of my hands.
>
> I won't let you GO!
> NO!
> A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds.
> Baby, I'm playing for keeps.
>
> The top of the hill was getting closer, closer.
> My heart was one big disaster.
> Voices in my head were calling me a coward.
> "Why don't you just go and ask her?"

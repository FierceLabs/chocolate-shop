#### Jared wrote the beginnings of this song in his youth. Dreams might fade with age, but we can choose to still believe. We still change and grow and learn. Rachelle helped finish the song in 2020.

> Watching our t-shirts age.
> They're faded, just like me.
> They're faded, like our dreams.
>
> We talked, we dreamed,
> we schemed of changing
> the world around us.
> Changing this life we know of.
>
> Did you think we could?
> I still believe we can.
> Do you think we should?
> I'm right there with you.
> There's nothing we can't do.
> This is not the end.
>
> We drove all night.
> We only saw as far as our eyes could see.
> Sang as loud as our lungs could sing.
>
> We talked, we dreamed,
> we schemed of changing

> Changing this life we know of.

> Did you think we could?

> There's nothing we can't do.
> This is not the end.

> Scars taught us to protect our hearts.
> Storms have battered all our, all our dreams on rocks so sharp.
> But the red sea is starting to part.
> Embers of the fires of hope are burning in the dark,
> as you and I go back to the start.
> This is not the end!

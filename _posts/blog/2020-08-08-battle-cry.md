#### Our battle is not against flesh and blood.

> It's a crying shame,
> all that's broke inside us.
> We try to hide it.
> We cover, cover it up.
>
> What would it be like,
> to be loved without our,
> without our guard up?
>
> Woah woh wooah woah
> Woah woh wooah woah
>
> My wounds are screaming,
> drowning out my dreams and
> any sort of feeling
> of some sort of connection.
>
> But, hey, I'm safe
> in a gilded cage.
> The door is open,
> but this bird, this bird stays.
> Why do you stay?
> Why do you stay?
>
> Woah woh wooah woah
> Woah woh wooah woah
>
> The mask is gone, it's cracked.
> My righteousness is filthy rags.
> When I think about the things I've done,
> and all the things they've done to me.
>
> Where's the stain?
> It's washed clean.
> And all my sins lie at the bottom of the sea!
>
> Can you taste it?
> Do you know what it tastes like?
> Or have you been chained your whole life?
>
> True love died to pay our freedom price.
>
> This is our battle cry!

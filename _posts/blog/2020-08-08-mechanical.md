#### Jared began to write this song in biology class. Some look at science and see a reason to evade God. We see a work of art, breathed into life by Holy breath.

> I'm mechanical, gears and sinew, rods and ventricles and scar tissue. I'm mechanical, bone rib cages, padded skeletal structural braces. If I'm mechanical, why does it feel like this, when my heart is dead, but my heartbeat persists? If I'm mechanical, made of heartless steel, why am I haunted by You, why am I haunted by You? 
>
> All of my demons hide until I try to fly. I've played a traitor's part in the battle for my heart. I've seen the Angels win the Pennant. I know what love can do when it's in it. I've watched an iron curtain fall. I don't know exactly how but love never backs down. 
>
> I am physical, trapped in space and time, always just one mile from the soft skyline. I am physical, here on Sixth and Main. On my warm skin I can feel the rain. You say I'm physical, but this trajectory is taking me places I can't see. If I am physical, made of flesh and bone, why am I haunted by You, why am I haunted by You?

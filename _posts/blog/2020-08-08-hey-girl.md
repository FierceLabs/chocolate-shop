#### We wrote this song during our honeymoon. It was a glimpse at our past and a hope for our future.

> Love is a rose, a wild, wild rose. 
> You can't have beauty without thorns.
> You've got to die to yourself. 
> You've got to think of someone else. 
> If love were a story, one to be told, 
> I'd want to be the hero. 
> But if it meant you'd succeed, 
> I'd give my sword, my shield, my steed. 
>
> Hey girl...
> Do you have to say it...
> Hey girl...
> Please I can't take it...
> I think I've fallen in love, in love, with you. 
>
> If love were a dance at a party, 
> I'd wonder why you would dance with me. 
> I'm not a flower on the wall. 
> To dance, you've got to give your trust. 
> You've got to give it all. 
>
> Do you have to say it...
> Hey girl...
> Please I can't take it...
> I think I've fallen in love, in love, with you. 
>
> Baby, baby one thing is true. 
> Insecurities won't keep me from you. 
> I won't let go of you. Hey Girl...
